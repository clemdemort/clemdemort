- Hi, I’m @clemdemort!
- I’m interested in computer graphics and game engines
- I’m currently learning how to use Linux so i might not be as active as i used to be(at least on here), progress should return soon(tm) though!
- I primarily use C++ in my applications
  but I also have some experience with python and C.
- I also have a lot of experience with
  mcfunction(Minecraft's datapack language)
  but that one is more for fun ;D

I will sometimes share some projects I'm working on
here, but they might vary a lot in nature since I
Tend not to commit to a single one :P

My goal around here is predominantly to learn,
have fun and maybe make something cool every
once in a while! :)
